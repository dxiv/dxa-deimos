// SDK Core Types - Common serializable types used by both SDK consumers and SDK builders.
//
// Types are generated from Zod schemas in coreSchemas.ts.
// To modify types:
// 1. Edit Zod schemas in coreSchemas.ts
// 2. Run: bun scripts/generate-sdk-types.ts
//
// Schemas are available in coreSchemas.ts for runtime validation but are not
// part of the public API.

// Re-export sandbox types for SDK consumers
export type {
  SandboxFilesystemConfig,
  SandboxIgnoreViolations,
  SandboxNetworkConfig,
  SandboxSettings,
} from '../sandboxTypes.js'
// Re-export all generated types
export * from './coreTypes.generated.js'

// Re-export utility types that can't be expressed as Zod schemas
export type { NonNullableUsage } from './sdkUtilityTypes.js'

// Single source of truth (matches Zod enums in coreSchemas.ts)
export { HOOK_EVENTS, EXIT_REASONS } from './coreSchemas.js'
