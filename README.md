# OpenClaude

**OpenClaude** is a **MIT-licensed** terminal coding agent: one `openclaude` command, your choice of model backend (OpenAI-compatible APIs, Gemini, GitHub Models, Ollama, Atomic Chat, and others), plus tools, **MCP**, and slash commands. This repo also includes a **VS Code extension** and a dark terminal theme.

## Why use it

- One CLI for cloud APIs and local inference
- `/provider` for guided setup and a saved profile
- Bash, file tools, grep/glob, agents, tasks, MCP, web helpers
- Optional VS Code integration from this repo

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @dxiv/openclaude
```

If the install later reports `ripgrep not found`, install ripgrep system-wide and confirm `rg --version` works in the same terminal before starting OpenClaude.

### Start

```bash
openclaude
```

Inside OpenClaude:

- run `/provider` for guided provider setup and saved profiles
- run `/onboard-github` for GitHub Models onboarding

### Fastest OpenAI setup

macOS / Linux:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o

openclaude
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI="1"
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
$env:OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"

openclaude
```

### Fastest local Ollama setup

macOS / Linux:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
export OPENAI_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:7b

openclaude
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI="1"
$env:OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1"
$env:OPENAI_MODEL="qwen2.5-coder:7b"

openclaude
```

## Setup Guides

Beginner-friendly guides:

- [Non-Technical Setup](docs/non-technical-setup.md)
- [Windows Quick Start](docs/quick-start-windows.md)
- [macOS / Linux Quick Start](docs/quick-start-mac-linux.md)

Advanced and source-build guides:

- [Advanced Setup](docs/advanced-setup.md) — Bun, profiles, `doctor:*`, env reference
- [Android (Termux)](ANDROID_INSTALL.md) — build inside proot Ubuntu when you need a phone/tablet setup

**Optional:** the [`python/`](python/) tree holds small **Python helpers** for provider experiments—not needed for normal CLI install. See [`python/README.md`](python/README.md).

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Setup Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI-compatible | `/provider` or env vars | Works with OpenAI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, LM Studio, and other compatible `/v1` servers |
| Gemini | `/provider` or env vars | Supports API key, access token, or local ADC workflow on current `main` |
| GitHub Models | `/onboard-github` | Interactive onboarding with saved credentials |
| Codex | `/provider` | Uses existing Codex credentials when available |
| Ollama | `/provider` or env vars | Local inference with no API key |
| Atomic Chat | advanced setup | Local Apple Silicon backend |
| Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry | env vars | Additional provider integrations for supported environments |

## What Works

- **Tool-driven coding workflows**: Bash, file read/write/edit, grep, glob, agents, tasks, MCP, and slash commands
- **Streaming responses**: Real-time token output and tool progress
- **Tool calling**: Multi-step tool loops with model calls, tool execution, and follow-up responses
- **Images**: URL and base64 image inputs for providers that support vision
- **Provider profiles**: Guided setup plus saved `.openclaude-profile.json` support
- **Local and remote model backends**: Cloud APIs, local servers, and Apple Silicon local inference

## Provider Notes

OpenClaude supports multiple providers, but behavior is not identical across all of them.

- Anthropic-specific features may not exist on other providers
- Tool quality depends heavily on the selected model
- Smaller local models can struggle with long multi-step tool flows
- Some providers impose lower output caps than the CLI defaults, and OpenClaude adapts where possible

For best results, use models with strong tool/function calling support.

## Agent Routing

OpenClaude can route different agents to different models through settings-based routing. This is useful for cost optimization or splitting work by model strength.

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agentModels": {
    "deepseek-chat": {
      "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-your-key"
    },
    "gpt-4o": {
      "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-your-key"
    }
  },
  "agentRouting": {
    "Explore": "deepseek-chat",
    "Plan": "gpt-4o",
    "general-purpose": "gpt-4o",
    "frontend-dev": "deepseek-chat",
    "default": "gpt-4o"
  }
}
```

When no routing match is found, the global provider remains the fallback.

> **Note:** `api_key` values in `settings.json` are stored in plaintext. Keep this file private and do not commit it to version control.

## Web Search and Fetch

By default, `WebSearch` works on non-Anthropic models using DuckDuckGo. This gives GPT-4o, DeepSeek, Gemini, Ollama, and other OpenAI-compatible providers a free web search path out of the box.

> **Note:** DuckDuckGo fallback works by scraping search results and may be rate-limited, blocked, or subject to DuckDuckGo's Terms of Service. If you want a more reliable supported option, configure Firecrawl.

For Anthropic-native backends and Codex responses, OpenClaude keeps the native provider web search behavior.

`WebFetch` works, but its basic HTTP plus HTML-to-markdown path can still fail on JavaScript-rendered sites or sites that block plain HTTP requests.

Set a [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) API key if you want Firecrawl-powered search/fetch behavior:

```bash
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

With Firecrawl enabled:

- `WebSearch` can use Firecrawl's search API while DuckDuckGo remains the default free path for non-Claude models
- `WebFetch` uses Firecrawl's scrape endpoint instead of raw HTTP, handling JS-rendered pages correctly

Free tier at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev) includes 500 credits. The key is optional.

## Source Build And Local Development

```bash
bun install
bun run build
node dist/cli.mjs
```

Helpful commands:

- `bun run dev`
- `bun test`
- `bun run test:coverage`
- `bun run security:pr-scan -- --base origin/main`
- `bun run smoke`
- `bun run doctor:runtime`
- `bun run verify:privacy`
- focused `bun test ...` runs for the areas you touch

## Testing And Coverage

OpenClaude uses Bun's built-in test runner for unit tests.

Run the full unit suite:

```bash
bun test
```

Generate unit test coverage:

```bash
bun run test:coverage
```

Open the visual coverage report:

```bash
open coverage/index.html
```

If you already have `coverage/lcov.info` and only want to rebuild the UI:

```bash
bun run test:coverage:ui
```

Use focused test runs when you only touch one area:

- `bun run test:provider`
- `bun run test:provider-recommendation`
- `bun test path/to/file.test.ts`

Recommended contributor validation before opening a PR:

- `bun run build`
- `bun run smoke`
- `bun run test:coverage` for broader unit coverage when your change affects shared runtime or provider logic
- focused `bun test ...` runs for the files and flows you changed

Coverage output is written to `coverage/lcov.info`, and OpenClaude also generates a git-activity-style heatmap at `coverage/index.html`.
